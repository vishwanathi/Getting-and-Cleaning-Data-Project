This is a readme markdown file for the project assignment for the
Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

The first part of the README file has information about the raw data.

The later part of the README file has information about the tidy
data, and the program that creates this tiday dataset

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.  

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'code-book' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The repo includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.MD'

- 'Codebook.txt': A file that contains information about each variable in the final tiday dataset.

- 'run_analysis.R': An R source-code that creates the tidy dataset from the raw files.


=========================================

The final dataset produce "project_final_ds.txt" is a tidy dataset because it contains the following:

1. Each variable that is measured is in one column.
2. Each different observation (in this case, the average for each subject for each activity) is in a different row.
3. There is a row on top with column names.
4. The column names are consistent, if one were to follow the explanations in the attached codebook.
5. There is a code book attached, that provides all required information.
